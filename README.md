üìò Repository Description  
Instagram Relational Database & Analytical Queries in SQL. This project implements a fully normalized relational database schema for an Instagram-like social media platform. It models core entities‚Äîusers, photos, hashtags, comments, likes, follows, and tagged photos‚Äîallowing for in-depth analysis of user behavior, engagement trends, and content performance. The repository includes complete table definitions, populated sample datasets, and analytical SQL queries designed to address real-world platform metrics such as active users, popular hashtags, follower growth, and viral posts.
